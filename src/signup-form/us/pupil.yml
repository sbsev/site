    title: Is online tutoring okay?
    notes: |
      Due to the pandemic, tutoring has to take place online in many places without personal meetings between pupils and students.

      Does the child have access to a laptop, tablet, etc. and is technically capable of receiving online tutoring? If not, [we can also help](/blog/spende-laptops).
